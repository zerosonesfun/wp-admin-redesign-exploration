# Admin Redesign Exploration
### (#adminmenuwrap height force fork)

Currently, the only difference between this fork and the original is, due to a plugin I use, an important CSS rule was being overwritten. This fork forces #adminmenuwrap height 100vh, even if another plugin/code tries to change it.
