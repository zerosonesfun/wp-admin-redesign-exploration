# Admin Redesign Exploration
### (#adminmenuwrap height force fork)

Differences between original and this fork:
- #adminmenuwrap height 100vh (Certain admin plugins may try to change the height of the admin menu. This fixes that.)
- iframe background transparent (Without this, areas such as the update page which uses an iframe have a dark background when they should have a light background in default mode.)
